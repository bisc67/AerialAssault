08-June-2001 v1.8 ADB
Removed dependency on sce libs EIntr() and DIntr() so compatible with earlier kernels

07-June-2001 v1.7 ADB
Added code to preserve the rest of the context in interrupt around system calls.
Now saves sa, fpregs, fcr31 also.

06-June-2001 v1.6 ADB
Added code to preserve lo, hi, lo1, hi1 registers in interrupt in case isceSifSetDma breaks them.

04-June-2001 v1.5 ADB
Samples written to uncached space to avoid cache inconsistencies in DMA'd sample data.
This was causing spurious extra KERNEL samples in first profile set.

01-Jun-2001 v1.4 ADB
Found it necessary to wrap DI/EI around the functions below to stop mysterious TLB errors.


31-May-2001 v1.3 ADB

Now includes two new functions

void snProfEnableInt(void);		// Enable the Profiler count/compare interrupt
void snProfDisableInt(void);		// Disable the Profiler count/compare interrupt

Note: snProfInit() will aitomatically enable the interrupt once everything is setup. These additional functions are only required if you wish to disable the and re-enable the interrupt around sections of your code.
