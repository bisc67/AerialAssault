DATE          VERSION    INITIALS    DESCRIPTION

13/07/2001    1.63.35    ADB         VIF/GIF codes in Tag now display actual memory address in DMA disassembly (not address in tag)
12/07/2001    1.63.34    MAR         - "Disasm to file" now displays a Save File common dialog. Start/End addresses are picked up from text selections
                                       and copied into the appropriate controls of the dialog
                                     - Right-clicking on a header file name in the source pane will add a 'open "header.h"' item to the context menu.
                                       This looks for the file in the SourceSearchPath and loads it into the current source pane.
                                     
12/07/2001    1.63.34    MAR         - Implemented Workspace pane to show files and browse information for the loaded ELF in a tree view.
                                       Context menu on each item in the tree view contains commands specific to the item (load for file, add bp for function etc.)
                                     - Implemented drag & drop. Items from the Workspace pane may be dragged to various panes to add/goto
                                       the item, add breakpoints etc.
12/07/2001    1.63.34    MAR         - Implemented text selections on Source, TTY and Disassembly panes. Source pane supports edit control-style
                                       keyboard accelerators (customisable). These panes also allow clipboard copying of the selection.
                                     - All charmap panes (with no selection) have a Copy command on the context menu. This will copy the contents
                                       of the current character map buffer to the clipboard.
                                     - Source pane context menu contains a suib-menu with a list of previous files loaded (max of 10). This is accessible from a
                                       keyboard accelerator. The list persists between sessions (saved in config file).
                                     - Watch window context menu contains "Paste Expression" command, allowing a word/expression to be copied from
                                       the source pane and pasted into the Watch window.
                                     - Any current selection in the source pane will automatically be added to the edit control of the Find dialog box.
                                     - Hover evaluation on the source pane will evaluate the current selection if there is one.
                                     
12/07/2001    1.63.32    ADB         Enabled DMA pane "save to text file" to save XGKICK packets from VU1
06/07/2001    1.63.31    ADB         Special build with Martin's new VU analyser (active only if VU pane open).
                                     This does not currently have the 1.63.30 extras.
06/07/2001    1.63.30    MND         Changed VU analyse code to hopefully reduce the amount of time it takes.

01/07/2001    1.63.28    MAR         fixed - DBG.H problem in eval versions was causing files ELF newer than 3rd July to fail.
                                     This was previously set to 3rd July, causing the debugger to abort loading of any ELF's built after this date.
